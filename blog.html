                <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
                <p>
                    Automotive chassis is an important part of an automobile. Chassis is considered as a major component of a vehicle system. It consists of internal framework that supports almost every single part of an automobile. It is the underpart of the vehicle which consists of frame and running gear like engine, transmission system, suspension system etc. The one of the major functions of chassis is that, it could withstand the shock, vibrations. It has to withstand centrifugal force while cornering and has to face bending stresses due to rise and fall of front and rear axles. As of the above points the maximum stress and deflection is necessarily considered while designing a chassis. This research is the work performed in finding the optimized chassis amongst the monocoque, ladder and tubular space frame chassis in view of sedans, hatches and crossovers. The paper describes a few points to be considered while designing a chassis frame. Keywords- Automotive chassis and frame, sedans, hatches, crossovers, monocoque chassis, ladder chassis, tubular space frame chassis.

                    <h4>Forces</h4>
                    <p>
                        Whatever chassis it is, it has to be stiff enough to withstand when engaged against the forces. This point immensely affects the suspension system. However, one cannot make a totally stiff chassis this will definitely make it a lot fragile. So, the conclusion is that one needs to achieve a point where it is neither too stiff nor too weak.

                    <h4>Monocoque Chassis</h4>
                    <p>
                        Monocoque is the shell made with the single material without making most of the cuts and parts to build a chassis, could be considered more of a unitized frame. Monocoque chassis has caused an uproar in the automobile industries these days and slowly with persistence is making its way to the list of bigger vehicles. Today almost every car developed on this globe is made of steel monocoque chassis, as it has got low manufacturing cost and majority of the work is robotized. Monocoque chassis is often referred to as a <em>“one-piece”</em> chassis which elucidate the general shape of the car. In fact, this so called one-piece chassis is actually produced by welding various pieces together.

                    <h4>How is it made?</h4> 
                    <p>
                       In case of the ladder frame manufacture, the frame here bears the load and body is tucked onto the frame separately. Unlike, in case of the monocoque frame manufacture the chassis as a whole unit is made separately by employing formed steel / aluminum panels which are welded together to form a structure to bear load. A carbon fusion monocoque chassis finds a substantial use in sports car industry. So, unlike ladder frame here in general whole-build acts as a load bearing member onto which suspension, engine and transmission is mounted.

                        <h4>Ladder Chassis</h4>
                        <p>
                            The name is obviously inspired from what it depicts <em>“The Ladder”</em> and is developed by supporting two longitudinal heavy beams with a two or more short beams. Ladder frame chassis is the simplest and primeval of the chassis design used in modern vehicles. Automotive industry is one of the biggest and most innovative industries. Almost all manufactured cars and vehicle are made by mass production but in the very beginning the cars were manufactured by the same technologies of hand craftsmanship that had been used for centuries for the construction of horse-drawn carriages. Due to the complication of large number of components and assembly rely on joining items the procedure has been changed. It has been started by Henry Ford who developed the techniques of mass production based on preliminary production of rifles during American Civil War. Ladder frame is originally inspired from the “horse carriage”. Ladder frame has various members that cross link to hold frame rails together. Ladder chassis is mostly used in heavy vehicles.

                    <h4>Tubular Space Frame</h4>
                    <p>
                        Tubular space frame Tubular space frame developed by motor racing engineers is used in motor sports industry as a matter of course, as ladder chassis being not so strong. A lot of circular cross section as well as a few may enlist square section tubes when manufacturing a tubular space frame chassis. These tubes are welded together to form a very complex structure. So, these cross sections are supposed to provide the mechanical strength when positioned in different directions when engaged against forces from any direction.

                        Well, as considering all the benefits and a few disadvantages it actually depends on the use, but here being more concerned about the <em>Regular On road Vehicles</em> or being specific <em>The Family Car</em> the monocoque chassis and the ladder chassis would be considered also the monocoque body is creeping its way to the biggest revolution in an automotive industryas it being the light weight, high strength and cheapest in view of mass production. Though it makes a point of using space frame chassis as being a more concerned about one's safety and also it would cost less when in mass production, but it would ensue at an expense of the space and the space criteria is essential to be considered here as the general consideration here is about the <em>“<b>family&nbsp;car</b>”</em>.
